# Foetal-Ultrasound-Simulator-LEAP
A proof of concept for a foetal cardiac ultrasound simulator using LEAP motion (https://www.leapmotion.com/) developed as part for the group project module of the MRes in Medical Robotics and Image-Guided Intervention at The Hamlyn Centre for Robotic Surgery, Imperial College London, 2015/2016. The simulator that is controlled by one’s hand, whose orientation on a pregnant mannequin's torso is determined using a Leap Motion: this will corresponds to the orientation of an ultrasound transducer. Using this imaging plane, the foetal cardiac mesh is sliced and displayed on the simulator.

MATLAB and C++ code written by L.Nuwan, I.Pulgar, S.Shanel, M.Tonutti.
