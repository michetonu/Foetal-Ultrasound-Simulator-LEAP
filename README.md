# Foetal-Ultrasound-Simulator-LEAP
A proof of concept for a foetal cardiac ultrasound simulator using LEAP motion, developed as part for the group project module of the MRes in Medical Robotics and Image-Guided Intervention at The Hamlyn Centre for Robotic Surgery, Imperial College London, 2015/2016. The simulator that is controlled by oneâ€™s hand, whose orientation on a pregnant mannequin's torso is determined using a Leap Motion: this will corresponds to the orientation of an ultrasound transducer. Using this imaging plane, the foetal cardiac mesh is sliced and displayed on the simulator.
